In this project we present the analysis of passing during a football match. By converting big data files into useful data and using social network analysis, we can construct a passing network, in which players are represented as nodes and passes between then as weighted edges. Once the network in constructed, we can focus on studying the relations between the nodes in order to extract meaningful information about their performance, as well as visualizing the network. We included measures such as degree, closeness, clustering centrality, PageRank score, edge connectivity, density, transitivity, modularity and others. We concluded that midfielders form the most important nodes of the network.
